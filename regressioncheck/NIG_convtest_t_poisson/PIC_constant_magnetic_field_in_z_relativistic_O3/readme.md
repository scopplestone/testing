# Particle Time Integration
+ relativistic case with Lorentz factor defined by PIC-AnalyticInterpolationGamma
* Magnetic field that constant in time and space Bz=const.
* The particles gyrates on a circular path
* Leapfrog time integration yields O(1) because the magnetic field is not correctly considered
