# Particle Time Integration
* Magnetic field that constant in time and varies in space Bz=B0*exp(x/l).
* The particles gyrates on a circular path while drifting in y-direction
* Leapfrog time integration would yield O(1) if the analytic solution was available 
  because the magnetic field is not correctly considered
