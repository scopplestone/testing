# 2D Landmark benchmark
- Boris-leapfrog time integration with cell volweight mean deposition on a 2D domain
- increased MPF from actual case by a factor of 100 (200 000 particles instead of 20mio initially)
- volume emission via ionization rate
- line emission (neutralizer) via excess of electrons that impact the anode at x=2.4cm
- corrected potential at x=2.4cm
