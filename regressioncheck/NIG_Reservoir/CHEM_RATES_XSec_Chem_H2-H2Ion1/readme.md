# XSec Chemistry: H2-H2Ion1
* Test the reaction rates using cross-section based chemistry and the vibrational relaxation rates of H2Ion1
* Actual number of reaction is counted (reactions are not performed)
* The collision energy is varied through the velocity (constant distribution)
* Figure_Verification.png shows the comparison with the theoretical rate
