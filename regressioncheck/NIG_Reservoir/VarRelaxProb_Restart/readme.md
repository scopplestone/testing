# Initial Autorestart with variable relaxation probabilities
* Test if a the code is able run variable relaxation probabilities without an runtime error and to save vibrational relaxation probabilities to mesh file and load them in a paroper way.
* 4 Species (2 molecular and 2 atoms)
* Settings:
  * PartDensity           = 4*1E20
  * MacroParticleFactor   = 1E10
  * Temperature           = 5000 K
