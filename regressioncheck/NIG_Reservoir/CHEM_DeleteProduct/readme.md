# Chemistry: Delete Reaction Products
* Test the routine to delete certain product species after a chemical reaction (e.g. neglect neutral species in an ionization process)
* Reservoir with equal parts carbon and electron, the resulting carbon ion from the chemical reaction is deleted immediately after the reaction
* Expected result: increased number of electrons and no ions
