# Multi-species background gas with collision cross-sections and TCE/QK chemistry
* Multi-species background gas with a CO2-N2-He reservoir using cross-section data (Phelps database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on February 18, 2020)
* Testing QK ionization and TCE dissociation
* Background gas at n = 6E23 1/m3 (equal parts CO2, N2, He), T=1000K
* Electrons at n = 1E21 1/m3, T=150000K
* Comparing the null collision method (number of pairs depends on the maximum collision frequency) with a regular treatment (all simulation particles are paired with the background gas)
