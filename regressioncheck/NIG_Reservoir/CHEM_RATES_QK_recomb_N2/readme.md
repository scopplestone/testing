# Chemistry
* Test the theoretical reaction rates for recombination of N2
* Verifying the correct QK implementation by determining the reaction rate
* Reference databases was generated with MPF=2 and shows acceptable agreement with Arrhenius and analytical QK rates
* Initial composition: n=2E23 at equal parts N2 and N
* Settings
  * BackwardReacRate       = true
  * DSMCReservoirSim       = true
  * DSMCReservoirSimRate   = true
  * DSMCReservoirStatistic = true
