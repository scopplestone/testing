# XSec Chemistry: Ar + e at relativistic electron velocities
* Ionization of Argon at high electron energies between 10 keV and 100 keV (-> ArIon1 + e + e)
* Test the reaction rates using cross-section based chemistry
* Actual number of reaction is counted (reactions are not performed)
* The collision energy is varied through the velocity (constant distribution)
* Figure_Verification.png shows the comparison with the theoretical rate
