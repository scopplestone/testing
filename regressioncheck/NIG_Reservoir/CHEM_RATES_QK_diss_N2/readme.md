# Chemistry
* Test the theoretical reaction rates for dissociation of N2
* Verifying the correct QK implementation by determining the reaction rate (counting the number of reactions)
* Reference databases show acceptable agreement with Arrhenius results and analytical QK rates
* Initial composition: n=2E23 at equal parts N2 and N
* Settings
  * BackwardReacRate       = true
  * DSMCReservoirSim       = true
  * DSMCReservoirSimRate   = true
  * DSMCReservoirStatistic = true
