# N2 Reservoir Relaxation
* Test relaxation of N2 from a thermal non-equilibrium to equilibrium (rotational, vibrational, electronic)
* Testing three different models
  * Liechty: Each simulation particle has a single energy level
  * Burt: Each simulation particle carries an electronic energy distribution functions
  * BGK-LT: Each simulation particle has a single energy level, relaxation with BGK type equation
* T_t = 50000K, T_r = 1000K, T_v = 15000K, T_e = 200000K
