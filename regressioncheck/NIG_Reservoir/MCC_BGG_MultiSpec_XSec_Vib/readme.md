# Vibrational rates through cross-section data
* Multi-species background gas with a CO2-N2-He reservoir using cross-section data (Phelps database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on February 18, 2020)
* Testing the calculation of the pair specific vibrational relaxation rate from cross-sectional data
* Adapting the constant velocity of the electrons from 1 eV to 50 eV
* Relaxation probability compared with the theoretical results (see Figure)
  * Input database in PICLas has more vibrational modes (all that are included in Phelps database)
  * Only three vibrational modes per species are used for the theoretical rate (thus the discrepancies in the comparison)
* "get_values.py" script can be utilized to collect the probability from the reference databases
