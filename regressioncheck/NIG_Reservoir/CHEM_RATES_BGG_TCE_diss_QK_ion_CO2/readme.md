# CO2 ionization (QK) and dissociation (TCE) with a background gas
* Reservoir at different constant temperatures testing the reaction rates of CO2 + e dissociation (TCE model) as well as ionization (QK model)
* Both rates are in good agreement with single reaction path simulations (e.g. only dissociation or QK)
* Dissociation rate compared with theoretical Arrhenius rate
* Mean free path compared with analytical solution
