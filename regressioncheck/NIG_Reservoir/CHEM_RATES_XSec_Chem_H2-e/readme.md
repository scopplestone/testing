# XSec Chemistry: H2 + e
* Dissociation (-> H + H + e), Ionization (-> H2Ion1 + e + e), Dissociative Ionization (-> H + e + e + HIon1), and Vibrational Relaxation of H2
* Test the reaction rates using cross-section based chemistry
* Actual number of reaction is counted (reactions are not performed)
* The collision energy is varied through the velocity (constant distribution)
* Figure_Verification.png shows the comparison with the theoretical rate
