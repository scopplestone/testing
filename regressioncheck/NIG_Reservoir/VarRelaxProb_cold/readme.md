# Relaxation of a cold reservoir of N2 with variable relaxation probabilities 
* Test of thermal relaxation 
* Settings
  * PartDensity           = 1E20
  * MacroParticleFactor   = 1E10
  * T_trans               = 5000
  * T_Rot                 = 10000
  * T_Vib                 = 1000
  * First, translational temperature rises, due to the higher rotational temperature and its faster relaxation. After total relaxation of the rotation, the translational temperature decreases, due to slower relaxation of the vibrational degrees of freedom. The position and and temperature of the plateau of translational temperature is very sensitive to the relaxation probabilities. Dissociation is neglected, due to short simulation time.
