# Chemistry
* Test the theoretical reaction rates for ionization and recombination of H
* Verifying the correct QK implementation by determining the reaction rate (counting the number of reactions)
* Reference databases show acceptable agreement with Arrhenius results and analytical QK rates
* Initial composition: n=3E23 at equal parts H, H+ and e
* Settings
