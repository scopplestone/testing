# Multi-species background gas: Electronic relaxation with cross-sections (Model = 3)
* Testing the multi-species background gas with a CO2-N2-He reservoir using MCC with effective cross-section data with/without Null Collision method (Phelps database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on February 18, 2020)
* Electronic relaxation based on cross-section data read-in from the database
* Background gas: 6E23 1/m3 (1/3 each), Electrons: n_e = 2E21 1/m3
* Adapting the constant velocity of the electrons from 20 eV to 400 eV
* Relaxation rates compared with the theoretical results (see Figure), no relaxation is performed
