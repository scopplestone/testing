# Multi-species reservoir with MCC
* Testing a CO2-N2-He reservoir using effective cross-section data (Phelps database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on February 18, 2020)
* Mixture: 2E22 1/m3 (1/3 each), Electrons: n_e = 2E22 1/m3
* Adapting the constant velocity of the electrons from 0.01 eV to 100 eV
* Collisional rates compared with the theoretical results (see Figure)
* "get_values.py" script can be utilized to collect the collision rates from the reference databases
