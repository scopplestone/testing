* Test ionization and recombination (H + M -> H + e + M) from a thermal and chemical non-equilibrium towards equilibrium
* Reference database compared with Saha equation
* Initial composition at 1.5e20 1/m3 with equal parts H, H+ and e- (for Saha equation only heavy particles are relevant -> n=1e20)
