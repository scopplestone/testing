# Titan Chemistry
* Reservoir with CH4 and N2, representative for the atmosphere of Titan
* Initial temperature at T = 25000K
* 18 species and 28 reactions based on the chemistry model by Goecken
* Testing two different models of electronic excitation
  * Liechty: Each simulation particle has a single energy level
  * BGK-LT: Each simulation particle has a single energy level, relaxation with BGK type equation
