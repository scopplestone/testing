# Multi-species reservoir with collision cross-sections and TCE/QK chemistry
* Multi-species reservoir with a CO2-N2-He reservoir using cross-section data (Phelps database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on February 18, 2020)
* Testing QK ionization and TCE dissociation
* Mixture at n = 6E22 1/m3 (equal parts CO2, N2, He), T=1000K
* Electrons at n = 2E22 1/m3, T=150000K
