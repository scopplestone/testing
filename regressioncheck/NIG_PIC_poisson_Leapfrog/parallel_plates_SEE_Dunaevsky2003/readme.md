# Secondary electron emission (Dunaevsky2003)
- 100000 e- are accelerated against the right electrode where secondary electron emission (SEE-E) is performed
- SEE model for Ar+ impact
  - described in M. Zeng, "Experimental investigation of dielectric wall material effects on low-power HEMP thruster", 2020 and
  - based on A. Dunaevsky, "Secondary electron emission from dielectric materials of a Hall thruster with segmented electrodes", 2003 that is used for quartz (SiO2) surfaces among others
  - SEE yield depends on impact energy and supplies two fits (power and linear) to the measured data
  - Tested energies and yields are
    -  100 eV, 1.0857
    -  700 eV, 1.37
    - 1000 eV, 1.94
- Compare number of particles: PartAnalyze.csv
  - output is compared with a reference value for const. collision energy of primary electrons of 50, 100 and 200 eV
