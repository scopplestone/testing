# Secondary electron emission (Theis2021/Phelps1999)
- 100000 Ar+ are accelerated against the right electrode where secondary electron emission (SEE-I) is performed
- SEE model for Ar+ impact
  - used in J. Theis, "Computing the Paschen curve for argon with speed-limited particle-in-cell simulation", 2021 and
  - based on A. Phelps, "Cold-cathode discharges and breakdown in argon: surface and gas phase production of secondary electrons", 1999 that is used for copper surfaces
  - SEE yield depends on impact energy and gives two functions for >700eV and <700eV
  - Tested energies and yields are
    -  100 eV, 0.081656
    -  700 eV, 0.09
    - 1000 eV, 0.11635
- Compare number of particles: PartAnalyze.csv
  - output is compared with a reference value for const. collision energy of primary electrons of 50, 100 and 200 eV
