# Plasma sheath with Boltzmann relation electrons
- automatic switch between BR and fully kinetic
- multiple-switch (kin->BR->kin->BR->kin....) continued for ever
- variable electron ref. properties, calculated automatically from kinetic simulation
- automatic load balance after the first time step for MPI>1
