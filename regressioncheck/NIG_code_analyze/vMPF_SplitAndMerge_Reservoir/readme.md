# Variable Weighting Factors - Split & Merge
* Testing the merging and splitting algorithms separately and a combination, where electrons are merged and ions are split
* Reservoir with open boundaries, particles leave the domain after a time step
* Merging:
  * Inserting 10000 particles every iteration, merging them to 1000 particles
* Splitting:
  * Inserting 100 particles every iteration, splitting them to 1000 particles
* All cases: energy and number density in the reservoir is constant
