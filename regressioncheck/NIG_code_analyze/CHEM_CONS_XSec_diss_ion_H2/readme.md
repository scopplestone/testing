# XSec Chemistry: Ionization (H2 + e -> H2Ion1 + e + e) and Dissociative Ionization, H2 + e -> H + e + e + HIon1
* Test the momentum and energy conservation of two reaction with three and four products
* Reservoir with a background gas (H2) and electrons as the sole particle species at a constant velocity
* Reactions are performed, leading to an increase in H, HIon1 and electrons and a reduction of the reservoir temperature
* Reaction rates are based on the read-in cross-section data
