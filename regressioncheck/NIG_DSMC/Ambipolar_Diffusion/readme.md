# MCC, Chemistry, Ambipolar Diffusion
* Reservoir initialized with neutral background gas and initial ion seed
* Electrons are treated with the ambipolar diffusion model (attached to the ion movement, but with their own velocity vector)
* Reference file was generated with electrons as particles
* Combinations:
  * DSMC with VHS
  * DSMC with cross-section data for probabilities
  * MCC with null-collision method
  * MCC without null-collision method
