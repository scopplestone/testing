# Surface Flux, Ambipolar Diffusion
* Empty computational Domains with surface flux of ions and electrons applied on all sides
* Electrons are treated with the ambipolar diffusion model (attached to the ion movement, but with their own velocity vector)
* Sanaty check will fail if there are a different number of electrons and ions in an element and leads to an abort
