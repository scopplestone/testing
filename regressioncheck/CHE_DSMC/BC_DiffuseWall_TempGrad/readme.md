# Linear temperature gradient along boundary wall
* Initialize reservoir at 4000K
* Linear temperature gradient at y-boundaries for the wall temperature along the x-axis
* Flow dominated by wall collisions
* Average temperature of the reservoir should rise to 7000K (Comparison of the sampled temperature distribution not practical due to statistical fluctuations)
