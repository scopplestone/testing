# Reservoir with a background gas
* Testing the collision probability calculation using the VHS model and MCC model (read-in of collisional cross-sections)
* Initial composition of He+ and e- and a background gas of He
* Ionization through Quantum Kinetic (QK) model
* Comparison of number density and temperature in the reservoir, similar result is expected as the collision cross-section of VHS model and the input cross section agree well at T=25eV
