# Multi-species background gas with VHS/MCC and basic vMPF
* Testing the multi-species background gas with a CO2-N2-He reservoir using the Variable Hard Sphere model
* Background gas: 6E23 1/m3 (1/3 each), Electrons: n_e = 1E21 1/m3
* Testing basic variable weighting factor functionality: combination of trace species and merge routine
  * Additional electrons are produced due to trace species split
  * Merged afterwards
* Number density and particle number should remain constant after the first merge to 400 particles
