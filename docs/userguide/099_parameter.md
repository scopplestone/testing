# Parameter file options

A ``parameter.ini`` file is needed to control the code. An overview of all options in the parameter file can be generated by following command in the terminal:

~~~~~~~
piclas --help
~~~~~~~

Generally, the following types are used:

~~~~~~~
INTEGER = 1
REAL    = 1.23456
LOGICAL = T ! True
LOGICAL = F ! False
STRING  = PICLAS
VECTOR  = (/1.0,2.0,3.0/)
~~~~~~~

The concept of the parameter file is described as followed:

* each single line is saved and examined for specific variable names
* the examination is case-insensitive
* comments can be set with symbol "!" in front of the text

    ```{code-block} fortran
    ! commented text
    ```

* numbers can also be set by using "pi"

    ~~~~~~~
    vector = (/1,2Pi,3Pi/)
    ~~~~~~~

* the order of defined variables is with one exception generally indifferent, but it is preferable to group similar variables
* the order becomes important only by modifying boundary conditions, if you want to modify a specific boundary by addressing its name, the related boundary type has to be defined

    ~~~~~~~
    BoundaryName=inflow         ! BC_Name defined in mesh file
    BoundaryType=(/2,0,0,0/)
    BoundaryName=outflow        ! BC_Name defined in mesh file
    BoundaryType=(/2,0,0,0/)
    ~~~~~~~

The following tables describe the main configuration options which can used in the parameter file.
