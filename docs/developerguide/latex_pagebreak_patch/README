A bug in the LaTeX longtable environment in some cases causes text to run out of the page. 
This causes some parts of the userguide to be not shown at all.
The problem is described here: 

https://www.latex-project.org/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html.new?pr=tools/3512

The longtable.sty file in this directory is a version where the bug is patched. 
You can find the original file e.g. with the command 

find /usr/share -name 'longtable.sty'

and replace it with the patched one, then 'make' again.
